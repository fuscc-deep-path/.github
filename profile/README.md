## Introduction - DeepPath ðŸ‘‹

To enable further validation of our finding and promote its clinical translation, we developed an online platform called DeepPath for data management and real-time one-stop prediction.

The DeepPath platform comprises two modules. The first is a data management module. All WSIs of the FUSCCTNBC cohort have been uploaded and can be viewed under 40Ã— magnification. The clinical and multi-omics information is presented in company with the WSI of the corresponding patient. The second is an online prediction module. We have modularized and deployed our complete prediction workflow and several validated models on the platform. It supports online real-time prediction for newly uploaded WSIs.


## Demo

To better demonstrate the capabilities of DeepPath, we provide an example based on the the Chinese Triple-Negative Breast Cancer cohort (Jiang, et al., 2019).
